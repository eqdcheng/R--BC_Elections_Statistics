Using R, I used tidyverse/ggplot to bootstrap and plot out the data. Then, I performed simliar operations on a single sample of the data to compare the similarities/differences in the two methods. I found they were very simliar, and bootstrapping yielded the same results as the single raw sample.

This was my original code, from a project in the course: Statistical Inference and Computation I at UBC
